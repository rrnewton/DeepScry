//! Unified trigger handling and placeholder resolution
//!
//! This module consolidates trigger-related functionality that was previously
//! duplicated across multiple functions (check_triggers, check_attack_triggers,
//! check_death_triggers, check_card_drawn_triggers, etc.).
//!
//! ## Key Components
//!
//! - `TriggerContext`: Encapsulates all context needed for trigger resolution
//! - `resolve_effect_placeholder`: Shared function for resolving placeholder values in effects
//! - Trigger matching logic via structured fields instead of string parsing
//!
//! ## Design Rationale
//!
//! Previously, each trigger handler had its own inline placeholder resolution logic,
//! leading to ~400+ lines of duplicated code. This module centralizes that logic
//! while preserving the specific behaviors needed for different trigger types.

/// ## Effect Coverage
///
/// This function handles placeholder resolution for all Effect variants that use placeholders:
/// - Player-targeting: DrawCards, DiscardCards, GainLife, Mill, Scry, Loot, AddMana, Firebend
/// - Permanent-targeting: PutCounter, PumpCreature, DestroyPermanent, ExilePermanent, etc.
/// - Token creation: CreateToken (controller placeholder)
/// - Damage: DealDamage (various target types)
///
/// Effects without placeholders pass through unchanged.

/// # Note
///
/// This function does not panic. The `unwrap()` for `ctx.drawing_player` is only called
/// after confirming `is_some()` via the match guard.
